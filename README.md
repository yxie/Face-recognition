# ENEE633---Face-recognization
Project 1 for ENEE633 Statistical Pattern Recognition course at UMD

This project implements the following classifiers for face recognition.
- ML estimation with Gaussian assumption followed by Bayes rule
- Nearest neighbor (NN) rule
- PCA followed by Bayes classifier and NN rule
- LDA followed by Bayes classifier and NN rule

Two different testing scenarios are performed:
- Test the impact of facial expressions, illumination variations
- Test the impact of training data size
